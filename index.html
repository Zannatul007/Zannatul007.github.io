		<h1><u>Definition</u></h1>
		A doodle is a drawing made while a person's attention is otherwise occupied. Doodles are simple drawings that can have concrete representational meaning or may just be composed of random and abstract lines, generally without ever lifting the drawing device from the paper, in which case it is usually called a "scribble".<br>
		Typical examples of doodling are found in school notebooks, often in the margins, drawn by students daydreaming or losing interest during class.Other common examples of doodling are produced during long telephone conversations if a pen and paper are available.<br>
		Popular kinds of doodles include cartoon versions of teachers or companions in a school, famous TV or comic characters, invented fictional beings, landscapes, geometric shapes, patterns, textures, or phallic scenes. Most people who doodle often remake the same shape or type of doodle throughout their lifetime.In this era it is so much popular to the artist,they suppose it is the best medium to express any incident with just one pen and a page.

		<h1><u>History</u></h1>
		The word doodle first appeared in the early 17th century to mean a fool or simpleton. It may derive from the German Dudeltopf or Dudeldop, meaning simpleton or noodle (literally "nightcap").It is the origin of the early eighteenth century verb to doodle, meaning "to swindle or to make a fool of". The modern meaning emerged as a term for a politician who was doing nothing in office at the expense of his constituents. That led to the more generalized verb "to doodle", which means to do nothing.
		<h1><u>Benefits</u></h1>
			According to a study published in the scientific journal Applied Cognitive Psychology, doodling can aid a person's memory by expending just enough energy to keep one from daydreaming, which demands a lot of the brain's processing power, as well as from not paying attention. Thus, it acts as a mediator between the spectrum of thinking too much or thinking too little and helps focus on the current situation.

			Doodling can be used as a stress relieving technique. This is similar to other motor activities such as fidgeting or pacing that are also used to alleviate mental stress. According to a review of over 9,000 submitted doodles, nearly 2/3 of respondents recalled doodling when in a "tense or restless state" as a means to reduce those feelings.Scientists believe that doodling's stress relieving properties arise from the way that the act of doodling engages with the brain's default mode network. Doodling is often incorporated into art therapy, allowing its users to slow down, focus and de-stress.</div>
