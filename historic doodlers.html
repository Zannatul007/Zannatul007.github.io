Full editions of Pushkin's doodles have been undertaken on several occasions.Some of Pushkin's doodles were animated by<b> Andrei Khrzhanovsky</b> and <b>Yuriy Norshteyn</b>in the 1987 film <b>"My Favorite Time"</b>

And, like most writers, not all of his works were successes. One of his novels, Murphy, was rejected 40 times before it was published in 1938 and never made much money.And it's those doodles that, for most of us, might be the most exciting part of the manuscript.
